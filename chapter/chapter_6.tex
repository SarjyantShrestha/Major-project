\chapter{Expected Outcomes}
	The deepfake detection algorithm is expected to classify the given input image into real or fake face. Expected results include higher levels of accuracy achieved by integrating state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and ensemble learning techniques.
	Additionally, it aims to improve generalization and robustness by training the model on different datasets and integrating adversarial training.
