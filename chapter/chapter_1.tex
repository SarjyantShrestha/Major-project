        \section{Background Introduction}
        NLP is a branch of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with computer human interaction, mainly how to design computers to process and evaluate huge volumes of natural language data \cite{asudani2023impact}. Pre-training of an NLP model plays an essential role in transfer learning, where a language model will be trained on a vast corpus set and later fine-tune the model for a specific purpose \cite{NepaliBERT}. Word embedding is a fundamental concept in NLP. It is a real-valued vector representation of words by embedding both semantic and syntactic meanings obtained from unlabeled large corpus \cite{Wang_Wang_Chen_Wang_Kuo_2019}. It is of n-dimensional distributed representation of a text that attempts to capture the meanings of the words \cite{asudani2023impact}. Word embeddings can be obtained using language modeling and feature learning techniques, where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers \cite{enwiki:1219561882}. Pre-trained word embeddings encode general word semantics and lexical regularities of natural language, and have proven useful across many NLP tasks, including word sense disambiguation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis, to name a few \cite{moreo2019wordclass}.\\\\
        Nepali is one of the languages that uses Devanagari, a script used in many languages spoken in Asian countries. It is spoken by more than 20 million people, mainly in Nepal, and other places in the world including Bhutan, India and Myanmar \cite{niraula2020linguistic}.  It has been rarely used for Natural Language Processing services.  Nepali can be quite complex due to its many sounds, grammar rules, and ways to change words. Due to its complex grammatical structure and rich characters, extracting fruitful information from the corpus has been challenging \cite{NepaliBERT}.\\\\
        The advancement of NLP technologies adapted to individual languages, like Nepali, hold immense potential for empowering communities and enhancing accessibility to digital resources for Nepali language. By filling the gap between technological innovation and linguistic diversity, we can unlock new possibilities for communication and education.\\\\
        \section{Problem Statement} 
        Even though Word Embeddings can be directly learned from raw texts in an unsupervised fashion, gathering a large amount of data for its training remains a huge challenge in itself for a low-resource language such as Nepali \cite{koirala-niraula-2021-npvec1}. Despite having breakthroughs in the field of NLP, productive results with the Nepali language have not been achieved. One of the primary reasons for this is the need for more computational resources \cite{NepaliBERT}.
